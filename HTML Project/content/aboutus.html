<p style="font-size:20px;">Hi, Gaurav here. Now the time has come to thank the person that inspired me to create something like this. To stop wasting time and actually do something. Well, I did something atleast, it's not perfect but I feel good about it. One of the very few people who actually makes me feel good no matter what, I seriously don't know how she does it. Hope you get all the good stuff because you obviously deserve it. Thank you <span style="color:red;"><b>Raveeeennnnaa ðŸ–¤</b></span><br>
Aaaannnnnnnd, now I leave you with one of the best Gina quotes ever.</p>
