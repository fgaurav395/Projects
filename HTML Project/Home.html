<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows a team of detectives headed by the overly serious, newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher). The detectives include Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), who frequently tops the squad in collars despite his relaxed, carefree attitude, much to the annoyance of his more stern and by-the-book partner, Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The hard-working but nebbish Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) is partnered with the stoic and sometimes aggressive Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Detectives Michael Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) and Norm Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) are older and often incompetent, although not without their usefulness.
</p><p>
The detectives report to Sergeant Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), a gentle giant and devoted family man who is initially afraid to go back to active police work for fear of dying in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. Rounding out the precinct is sarcastic civilian administrator Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti), who dislikes her job, and prefers to enjoy her social life.
